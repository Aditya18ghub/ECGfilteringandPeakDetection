# ECGfilteringandPeakDetection
This is a part of my work during my time as a research intern at DEBEL DRDO. The university third year internship at the research organization involved analyzing biomedical signals -ECG and EEG implementing signal processing techniques 
as well as a continuation of the work as i attempted to incorporate the compressive sensing acquisition paradigm for ECG signals ( code can be found in another repository - https://github.com/Aditya18ghub/CSAcquisitionforECG )
